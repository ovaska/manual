# Lithium Requirements

## Web Server

You need a web server to run Lithium, preferably running on your local machine (you do all of your development locally, right, right??). As with PHP, Lithium runs fine on most all popular web servers. Setup guides are available for:

 * [Apache](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/servers/apache.wiki)
 * [Cherokee](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/servers/cherokee.wiki)
 * [IIS](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/servers/iis.wiki)
 * [LigHTTPD](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/servers/lighttpd.wiki)
 * [Lightspeed](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/servers/lighttpd.wiki)
 * [Nginx](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/servers/nginx.wiki)

  Because Lithium takes advantage of advanced language features, the minimum version requirement is PHP 5.3.

 * Web server
 * PHP 5.3+

## Database

Applications built with Lithium often feature some sort of data store. As such, you may want to track down one of the following as well:

 * [MongoDB](http://lithify.me/docs/manual/configuration/connections/mongodb-setup.wiki)
 * MySQL
 * SQLite
 * CouchDB

## Helpful Additions

While not absolutely essential, a working knowledge of the [Git version control system](http://git-scm.com/) is useful for most aspects of development in general, and Lithium specifically. The Lithium plugin installation/repository tools rely on Git, and the workflow for contributing to projects is Git-based.

Command-line terminal is also not required for working with Lithium itself however it provides many useful tools for automating complex or repetitive tasks.

Most important of all is passion for innovation and collaboration!
